          <h3>How It Works</h3>
          <p>A Lexus hybrid has both a combustion engine, which is fuelled by petrol, and an electric motor, which is fuelled by high-tech batteries, 
            that don't require a plug-in. While the petrol engine runs, it powers a generator which in turn charges the batteries.</p>
